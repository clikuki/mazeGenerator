						<ol>
							<li>Collect all the cells in the maze into a single region.</li>
							<li>
								Split the region into two, using the following process:
								<ol>
									<li>
										Choose two cells from the region at random as “seeds”. Identify one as
										subregion A and one as subregion B. Put them into a set S.
									</li>
									<li>Choose a cell at random from S. Remove it from the set.</li>
									<li>
										For each of that cell's neighbors, if the neighbor is not already
										associated with a subregion, add it to S, and associate it with the
										same subregion as the cell itself.
									</li>
									<li>
										Repeat 2.2 and 2.3 until the entire region has been split into two.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								Construct a wall between the two regions by identifying cells in one
								region that have neighbors in the other region. Leave a gap by omitting
								the wall from one such cell pair.
							</li>
							<li>Repeat 2 and 3 for each subregion, recursively.</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Based off of the recursive division algorithm, but avoid the issue of
								straight lines by creating more natural walls
							</li>
							<li>Much slower than the original algorithm</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Aldous-Broder algorithm</span>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a walker, starting from a random spot on the grid</li>
							<li>
								Walk to a random neighbor, carving a hole in between if that neighbor is
								unvisited
							</li>
							<li>Repeat until all cells are visited</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Creates a uniformly spanning tree, ie. corridors, dead-ends, and
								junctions are completely random, and the maze has no distinguishable
								features unlike Recursive Division's chambers
							</li>
							<li>
								Very slow - Fast in the beginning but slows down by the end, as there
								are less cells to carve
							</li>
							<li>Not guaranteed to finish - Could keep generating for forever!</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Wilson's algorithm</span>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Create a walker, starting from a random spot on the grid. Initialize one
								of the cells as part of the maze
							</li>
							<li>
								Randomly walk around the grid, keeping track of the direction taken when
								leaving a cell
							</li>
							<li>
								When the walker arrives at a part of the maze, return to the walker's
								start and follow the directions taken at each cell
							</li>
							<li>
								Move the walker to a random unvisited cell and repeat the walk until all
								cells are visited
							</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>Creates a uniformly spanning tree</li>
							<li>
								Very slow - Slow at the start, but gets faster as it creates more cells
								for it to path back to
							</li>
							<li>Not guaranteed to finish - Could keep generating for forever!</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span> Aldous-Broder + Wilson's hybrid algorithm </span>
						<ul>
							<li>
								A mix of the Aldous-Broder and Wilson's algorithm, using the former at
								the start to create a large amount of visited cells for the latter to
								path back to
							</li>
							<li>
								May not create a uniformly spanning tree (Haven't researched that yet)
							</li>
							<li>
								Average to slow - Faster than its constituent algorithms but still takes
								longer than other algorithms due to its randomness
							</li>
							<li>Not guaranteed to finish - Could keep generating for forever!</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Binary Tree</span>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Start at the corner of the grid opposite to a chosen directional bias
								(eg. south-east, north-west)
							</li>
							<li>
								For each cell, carve a wall randomly in one of the chosen directions
								(horizontal or vertical). If a direction is blocked, choose the other.
							</li>
							<li>When the last cell is reached, the maze is complet</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>Creates a binary tree, as the name suggests</li>
							<li>
								Has a strong diagonal bias, as well as long corridors at the two end
								edges
							</li>
							<li>
								Memory efficient - Its main selling point. As it only looks at the
								current cell, it needs very little state. If using a seedable PRNG,
								instead of keeping the maze in memory, it can just regenerate the maze
								when needed. This allows for absolutely massive mazes that don't use too
								much memory
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Kruskal's</span>
						<ol>
							<li>Make a set E of all edges in the maze</li>
							<li>
								While E is not empty:
								<ol>
									<li>Set A as a random edge from E and remove it from the set</li>
									<li>
										If the sets at each side of A are disjoint, remove/carve A from the
										maze.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Slow - the number of edges are directly proportional to the width and
								height of the grid
							</li>
							<li>Creates many short dead-ends</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Prim's</span>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Choose a random cell as the starting point, and add its neighbors to the
								set F
							</li>
							<li>
								While set F is not empty:
								<ol>
									<li>Set C as a random cell in F and remove it from the set</li>
									<li>Carve a wall from C to any adjacent visited cell</li>
									<li>Add all unvisited neighbors of C to F</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>Creates many short dead-ends</li>
							<li>
								All paths tend to go back to the algorithm's starting point, which may
								be undesirable
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Eller's</span>
						<ol>
							<li>Initialize the first row by adding each cell into their own set</li>
							<li>
								For each row except the last:
								<ol>
									<li>Merge some of the sets together</li>
									<li>
										For each set, pick a random cell in the set and carve down to the next
										row.
									</li>
									<li>Initialize the next row's remaining cells in their own set</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>On the last row, connect every disjoint cell together</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Slow/Quick - Can be fast if set operations are fast and went row-by-row
								instead cell by cell
							</li>
							<li>Can create infinitely long or tall mazes</li>
							<li>
								Usually creates a long corridor at the end where most paths pass through
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Sidewinder</span>
						<ol>
							<li>Start from the corner cell, and create set R</li>
							<li>
								For each cell C:
								<ol>
									<li>Add C to R</li>
									<li>Decide whether to carve to the next cell or not</li>
									<ul>
										<li>If on the first row, carve to the next cell</li>
										<li>If at the end of the column, do not carve</li>
										<li>Otherwise, pick randomly</li>
									</ul>
									<li>
										If we did not carve, pick a random cell to carve vertically from.
										Empty set R
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The Sidewinder is called so because you can solve the maze from bottom
								to top by winding side to side and going up when possible
							</li>
							<li>Creates a long corridor at the top where most paths pass through</li>
							<li>
								It is impossible for northern dead-ends to occur with this algorithm
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Hunt And Kill</span>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a walker, starting from a random spot on the grid</li>
							<li>Walk to a random unvisited neighbor and carve a wall in between</li>
							<li>
								If all neighbors are visited, "hunt" for an unvisited cell neighboring a
								visited cell and start the walker from there
							</li>
							<li>
								The maze is finished when we can no longer find any unvisited cells
							</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Very similar to the recursive backtracking in features and generation,
								the only difference is that instead of backtracking, it searches through
								the maze instead.
							</li>
							<li>
								My implementation includes an optimization where it remembers the row it
								last found an unvisited cell, which speeds up the later phases when most
								of the maze is already visited
							</li>
							<li>
								Slow - Only updates one cell per step and can take some time to find an
								unvisited cell when in the hunt phase
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Growing Tree</span>
						<ol>
							<li>Create list S and initialize it with a random cell</li>
							<li>
								While S is not empty:
								<ol>
									<li>Pick cell C from the list</li>
									<li>
										Select a neighbor of C to carve to and add it to the S. If there are
										no unvisited neighbors, remove C from S
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								While simple, the fun of this algorithm comes from how you pick cells
								from the list
								<ul>
									<li>
										Picking the newest/last leads it to act like the Recursive
										Backtracking Algorithm
									</li>
									<li>Picking randomly leads it to act like Prim's</li>
									<li>
										Picking the oldest/first leads it to create long straight corridors
									</li>
								</ul>
								You can also mix these picking styles to create interesting and varied
								mazes
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

						>EXTRA: Maze Solver algorithms</span
					>
					<li>
						<span>Flood-Fill Algorithm</span>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a list L of all dead-ends in the maze</li>
							<li>
								While L is not empty:
								<ol>
									<li>Pick a random dead-end D and fill it in</li>
									<li>
										If D has a neighbor with a wall count (including filled in cells)
										greater than 1, add it to L
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If a maze is imperfect (has loops, multiple solutions), it will feature
								multiple unfilled paths. BFS, A*, or a similar algorithm could then be
								used to find the shortest route among them
							</li>
							<li>
								Requires full knowledge of the maze, unlike other algorithms that use
								walkers
							</li>

						<ol>
							<li>
								Create the following:
								<ul>
									<li>Set O containing the set of all open/fringe/frontier nodes</li>
									<li>Map G containing the cost of traveling to a node</li>
									<li>
										Function H that calculates the hueristic for any given cell, which can
										be the distance from the node to the end node
									</li>
									<li>Map F to store the sum of a node's G and H</li>
									<li>Map P to store a nodes parent</li>
								</ul>
								Let start be the start of the maze, and initialize O, G[start], and
								F[start] with start, 0 and H(start), respectively
							</li>
							<li>
								While O is not empty:
								<ol>
									<li>
										Let N be the node in O with the lowest F, and remove it from the set
									</li>
									<li>
										If N is the destination, end the search and trace the path by
										following P[goal] until start is reached
									</li>
									<li>
										For each of N's neighbors M:
										<ol>
											<li>Let New_G be the cost of going from N to M</li>
											<li>
												If New_G &lt; G[M], then:
												<ol>
													<li>Add M to O</li>
													<li>Set P[M] to N</li>
													<li>Set G[M] to New_G</li>
													<li>Set F[M] to New_G + H(M)</li>

										</ol>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>If O is empty, the search has failed</li>
